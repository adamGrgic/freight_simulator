The idea of this project is to create a game-like scenario for managing freight
companies.


Level 1 - Start as a single freight company
    + run a single freight services company out of <place>
    + have a set budget
    + set profit goals
    + methods of transportation
    +

In the background, goods and services are being exchanged
businesses open and close regularly
    - should get a database of industries
    - find out which businesses could be good demos


    - BusinessEntity
        + business_id
        + (abstracted probably) chance to make sale / transaction
        + employees
        + industry

    - Population
        * number of people in the game


    - Industries
        + Farming / Agriculture
        + Finance and Business
        + Healthcare and Pharma
        + Manufacturing and Industrial
        + Retail and Consumer Goods


    - Services  (General)
        + Freight Truck
        + Air
        + Hypersonic missle (late game)
        + Bus
        + Train
        + Boat
        +

    - External Factors
        + Gas prices
        + Road taxes
        + Employment
        + Armed robbery / theft
        + Climate
        + Government


    - Character roles
        * give you base advantages
            -> Ex: lone tech nerd ceo -> better tech efficiency, labor
            efficiency is slightly worse
            -> shrewd business man -> labor efficiency is better , people are
            more likely to leave
            -> cult leader -> slower start up, 'stickier' client base



(Sidenote: lemonade could be a good game idea for python)

Offer variety of transportation platforms (like buses, airplanes, boats, etc)


Have other freight companies available as competition

Create stages like in Tropico where you're dependent on the crown in the first
age then eventually move on and do your own dang thing




Ideas for later stage:
    - hire security to protect cargo
    - relationship with government
